# Battleships

This is a really cool game I played when I was little, so I was excited to see it [on Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52bb6539a4cf1b12d90005b7)

# Setup

0. Fork/clone this repo
1. Install Ruby 2.7.2 (I recommend using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv))
2. Install Bundler (`gem install bundler`)
3. Install the required gems (`bundle install`). It's only `rspec` for writing specs, but I've included a [convenient debugger](https://github.com/pry/pry) for you too.
4. Make a branch, then add your thoughts in code to `battleships.rb` until the specs pass (`bundle exec rspec battleships_spec.rb`). Push commits, as you go along.
